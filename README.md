## Motivation  

Epileptic seizures are unpredictable and can seriously disrupt the lives of patients and their families. Imagine being at school, work, or even crossing the street and suddenly experiencing a seizure without warning. While EEG (brain activity) is the gold standard for monitoring, it often struggles to detect non-motor seizures, which occur without visible physical signs.  

That‚Äôs where **multimodal signals** come in. By combining EEG with EMG (muscle activity), we can capture hidden physiological patterns that a single signal might miss, like subtle muscle responses before a seizure starts.  

This project was developed to explore whether **deep learning** can uncover those early warning patterns. The goal isn‚Äôt just improving accuracy numbers in MATLAB, it‚Äôs about moving a step closer to systems that could one day give patients a **‚Äúseizure forecast,‚Äù** helping them live more safely and independently.
